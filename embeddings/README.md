# Embedding dictionaries 
The embeddings used for the evaluation of this paper can be found in its corresponding repositories on Zenodo. Embeddings are stored as a JSON file, where the key is the SNOMED CT identifier and the value is the corresponding embedding. Take into consideration that the dimension of the embedding varies according to the encoder used.
