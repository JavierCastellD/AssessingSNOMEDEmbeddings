# Assessing the Effectiveness of Embedding Methods in Capturing Clinical Information from SNOMED CT
This repository contains all the code developed for the article *Assessing the Effectiveness of Embedding Methods in Capturing Clinical Information from SNOMED CT*. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical properties encoded in embeddings through probing. More specifically, we focus on which SNOMED CT characteristics can be found on embeddings generated by different encoders. The scripts used to train the probe, as well as to generate the datasets for each task can be found here.
